				<h2 class="section-title">Background</h2>
				<div class="content">
					In the sun-drenched city of CÃ³rdoba, nestled in Andalusia,
					my digital journey began seven years ago. While my true
					passion and expertise lie in native mobile application
					development, particularly for Android, my initial foray into
					the web was somewhat accidental. It started with the humble
					task of tweaking websites built with WordPress. Due to a
					twist of fate, I found myself working with PHP files, where
					I was primarily changing existing text and elements, a
					foundational step that, while not my primary focus, hinted
					at the power beneath the surface.
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					This initial tinkering sparked an insatiable desire to build
					from the ground up. Driven by self-learning, I delved into a
					multitude of technologies, eventually leading me to my core
					interest: crafting robust and engaging native Android
					applications. Creating my first functional hybrid mobile
					application, built personally as a hobby, became a valuable
					learning experience along the way, a testament to my
					dedication and expanding skillset.
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					Along this path, a keen eye for efficiency emerged in me. I
					possessed a knack for identifying the invisible burdens that
					slowed down digital experiences, whether on the web or
					within mobile apps. Time and again, I stepped into projects
					plagued by sluggish performance due to excessive workloads.
					With methodical precision and a deep understanding of
					optimization techniques, I consistently achieved remarkable
					transformations, often reducing application or website load
					times by an impressive 80%.
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					However, it's in the realm of mobile applications,
					especially Android, where I truly thrive. There's a
					particular joy in witnessing a project gradually take the
					exact shape I initially envisioned. The ideas that once
					existed purely in my mind become tangible realities on a
					screen, and seeing those past thoughts so clearly manifest
					in a working application is a truly rewarding experience.
					This tangible evolution, from concept to functional mobile
					app, is what I find particularly captivating about software
					development.

				<h2 class="section-title">Education</h2>
				<div class="content">
					My foundational journey into the tech world began with a
					"Middle-Grade Vocational Training Cycle" from 2013 to 2015.
					While the curriculum of this initial course was not directly
					focused on programming, it was during the mandatory
					practical work experience within this program that I first
					encountered and began to explore the world of software
					development. This initial exposure sparked a significant
					interest and laid the groundwork for my subsequent pursuit
					of programming.
				</div>
				<div class="content">
					Following this introductory experience, I enrolled in and
					completed a "Higher-Grade Vocational Training Cycle in
					Multiplatform Application Development" from 2015 to 2017.
					This intensive program provided me with a comprehensive and
					in-depth education in software development principles,
					methodologies, and various programming languages, allowing
					me to fully immerse myself in the field and solidify my
					skills.
